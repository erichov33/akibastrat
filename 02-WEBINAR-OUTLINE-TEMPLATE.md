#### **⏰ MINUTE 2-5: THE PROBLEM**

**Hook Statement:**
> "70% of African SMEs are creditworthy but invisible to traditional lenders. 
> Let me show you why—and what we can do about it."

**Content:**
1. **The Financial Exclusion Crisis**
   - 70%+ SME rejection rates
   - $5 trillion credit gap in Africa
   - Traditional scoring fails for informal economies

2. **Why Traditional Credit Bureaus Fall Short**
   - Require formal credit history (90% don't have)
   - Miss transaction behavior data
   - Can't assess business momentum
   - Slow, expensive, limited coverage

3. **The Cost to Lenders**
   - Lost revenue opportunities
   - High CAC for slim approval rates
   - Competitors eating market share
   - Regulatory pressure for inclusion

**Slide Content:**
- Statistics with sources
- Problem visualization (funnel showing 70% dropoff)
- Customer pain points

**Speaker Notes:**
"Pause for impact after the 70% stat. Ask: 'How many of you see this in 
your own portfolios?' Make it interactive."

#### **⏰ MINUTE 5-15: THE SOLUTION (ALTERNATIVE DATA)**

**Section Title:** "What Alternative Data Reveals About Credit Risk"

**Content Blocks:**

Result: APPROVED - performing loan, zero defaults
```

- More signals = better decisions
- Real-time vs. historical
- Behavioral patterns > single scores
- Inclusive without being risky

**4. ROI for Lenders (5 min)**

require explicit customer consent. We never sell data.

Let's discuss your specific volume in a consultation.

**Q: How long to implement?**
A: Standard API integration: 2-4 weeks. We handle most of the work. 
Pilot programs can start in 1 week.

**Q: Can we test it first?**

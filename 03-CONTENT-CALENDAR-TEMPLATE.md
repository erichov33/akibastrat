"Before Akiba, we were rejecting 60% of applications. 
Not because they were risky - we just couldn't assess 
them properly.

With alternative data, we can now see transaction 
patterns, payment history, business growth. Our 
approval rate went from 40% to 65%.

The best part? Our default rate actually went DOWN. 
We're lending more, to better customers, with less risk.

If you're serious about financial inclusion without 
compromising on risk, talk to Akiba."

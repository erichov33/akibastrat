## 📍 PHASE 1: WELCOME & CONTEXT (15 MIN)

### **Minute 0-5: Opening**

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Good morning/afternoon everyone! Thanks for being here.

Today we're going to do something important: define what Akiba 
stands for and how we're going to get the market's attention.

Why does this matter? 

We have amazing technology. We solve a real problem. But right 
now, our brand isn't strong enough. People don't know us, don't 
understand us, or don't remember us.

That changes today.

By the end of this session, we'll have:
• A clear brand position
• Defined values and voice
• Bold activation ideas
• A plan to execute

Everyone's input matters. There are no bad ideas. Let's build 
this together."
```

**Slide:** Title slide with workshop goals

---

### **Minute 5-10: Ground Rules**

**Display on Screen:**

**Workshop Rules:**
1. 📱 **Phones on silent** (unless you're on call)
2. 💬 **All ideas welcome** - no judgment
3. ⏰ **Respect time** - we'll keep things moving
4. 🎯 **Stay focused** - side conversations later
5. ✅ **Participate** - introverts, we need you too!
6. 🤝 **Build on ideas** - "yes, and..." not "yes, but..."
7. 🎉 **Have fun!** - This should be energizing

**Facilitator says:**
"Quick question: Who's excited to be here? (pause for hands)
Who's skeptical this will work? (pause, acknowledge)
That's perfect. We need both energy and healthy skepticism."

---

### **Minute 10-15: Icebreaker**

**Activity: "Two Truths and a Wish"**

**Instructions:**
```
"Let's warm up. Everyone shares 3 things:
• Two truths about yourself (fun facts)
• One wish for Akiba's brand

Example: I'm a twin, I've been to 12 countries, and I wish 
Akiba was the first name people think of for alternative credit.

Let's go around quickly - 30 seconds each!"
```

**Why this works:** Gets everyone talking, connects personal to professional, surfaces hopes for the brand.

---

## 📍 PHASE 2: BRAND FOUNDATION (90 MIN)

### **Section A: Brand Story (30 min)**

#### **Minute 0-5: Frame the Exercise**

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Every great brand has a story. Not the story we tell 
ourselves internally, but the story that makes customers 
care. Let's find Akiba's story."
```

**Display Prompt:**
> "What's the 'aha moment' that created Akiba?  
> What customer problem keeps you up at night?"

---

#### **Minute 5-15: Individual Brainstorm**

**Instructions:**
```
"Take 10 minutes. On your worksheet, write down:

1. The customer problem that motivated Akiba
2. Why traditional solutions fail
3. What moment made you realize we needed to exist

Be specific. Real stories, not generic statements."
```

**Facilitator Actions:**

- Play soft background music
- Walk around, offer encouragement
- Give 2-minute warning

---

#### **Minute 15-25: Group Share & Synthesis**

"Let's hear your stories. Who wants to start?"

(As people share, write key themes on whiteboard)
```

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Capture exact phrases people use
- Look for patterns (what's repeated?)
- Highlight emotional moments
- Ask clarifying questions:
  - "Can you give me a specific example?"
  - "How did that make you feel?"
  - "What would change if we solved this?"

**Common Themes to Listen For:**

- Market opportunity
- Technology possibility

---

#### **Minute 25-30: Craft the Story**

**Facilitator Action:**
```
"I'm hearing these themes: [list 3-4 main themes]

Let's craft our story. Fill in the blanks together:

Akiba exists because _______________________________

Traditional approaches fail at ____________________

We believe __________________________________________

Our vision is _______________________________________"
```

**Capture Output:**

- Take photo
- Add to shared doc
- Circle back at end

---

### **Section B: Values (20 min)**

#### **Minute 0-5: Values Framework**

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Values are not what we ASPIRE to be. They're what we 
already ARE - and what we'd never compromise, even for profit.

Let's identify Akiba's true values."
```

**Display:** Examples of good vs. vague values
- Good: "Data-Driven Fairness - We believe numbers tell better stories than bias"
- Vague: "Innovation" (everyone claims this)

---

#### **Minute 5-12: Value Brainstorm**

**Activity: "3-2-1 Exercise"**

**Instructions:**
```
"On post-it notes, write:
• 3 values you see in Akiba's culture TODAY

• 1 value we'd never compromise

One value per post-it. Be specific."
```

**Facilitator:**
- Give out post-it notes

wall/board. Let's cluster similar themes."
```

**Facilitator Actions:**

- Read them aloud as you cluster
- Ask: "Do these belong together?"
- Name each cluster (5-6 clusters max)

---

#### **Minute 17-20: Pressure Test**

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Let's pressure test these. For each cluster, ask:
'Would we sacrifice profit for this?'

If yes → it's a real value
If no → it's a preference, not a value"
```

**Narrow to 3-4 Core Values**

---

### **Section C: Positioning (40 min)**

#### **Minute 0-10: Positioning Formula**

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Positioning is THE most important thing we'll do today.
It's how we differentiate in the market.

Use this formula:
'We are the [CATEGORY] for [AUDIENCE]
Unlike [ALTERNATIVES], we [UNIQUE APPROACH]
So that [TRANSFORMATION] happens'"
```

**Show Examples:**
- Alternative A: "We're the alternative credit scoring platform..."
- Alternative B: "We're the risk decisioning engine..."
- Alternative C: "We're the financial intelligence layer..."

**Instructions:**
"Let's work in small groups. 3-4 people per group.
You have 10 minutes to craft a positioning statement."

---

#### **Minute 10-30: Small Group Work**

**Facilitator Actions:**
- Break into groups (if virtual, use breakout rooms)
- Give each group a digital workspace
- Circulate between groups
- Offer prompts if stuck:
  - "Who is your customer? Be specific."

  - "What makes you different? Not better - different."

**Groups Present:**
Each group shares their positioning (2 min each)

---

#### **Minute 30-40: Dot Voting & Refine**

**Instructions:**
```
"We've heard all the options. Now let's vote.

Everyone gets 3 dots (or votes). Put them on the 
positioning statement(s) that resonate most."
```

**Output:** Final positioning statement that everyone can remember

---

## 📍 PHASE 3: ACTIVATION IDEAS (60 MIN)

### **Minute 0-5: Frame the Challenge**

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Great! We know WHO we are and WHAT we stand for.

Now: How do we get noticed?

We need bold ideas - activation campaigns that will 
get Akiba in front of our target market in the next 90 days.

Think: webinars, content series, partnerships, events, 
stunts, whatever. No idea too crazy."
```

---

### **Minute 5-20: Rapid Ideation**

**Activity: "Crazy 8s"**

**Instructions:**
```
"Take a piece of paper. Fold it to make 8 boxes.

You have 8 minutes to sketch 8 different activation ideas.
One idea per box. Drawings are fine - this isn't art class.

Timer starts... NOW!"
```

4. What's the risk?
5. What's the potential impact?

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Keep discussions focused
- Capture concerns and excitement
- Push for specifics ("How exactly would we do this?")
- Note resource requirements

---

### **Minute 55-60: Prioritization**

**Activity: Impact vs. Effort Matrix**

**Draw 2x2 Matrix:**
```
High Impact  |  Quick Win  |  Big Bet
             |             |
-------------|-------------|----------
Low Impact   |  Time Sink  |  Money Pit
             |             |
             Low Effort    High Effort
```

**Instructions:**

Where does each one belong?"

```
"Great work! We've got positioning, values, and activation ideas.

Now: What are we doing FIRST?"
```

**Instructions:**
"Let's identify:
• 3 Quick Wins (start this week)
• 2 Big Bets (plan for next month)
• 1 Stretch Goal (dream big)"

**Use Template:**
```
QUICK WIN 1:
What: _________________________
Who: _________________________
By When: _____________________
Success: _____________________

[Repeat for all items]
```

---

### **Minute 10-15: Ownership**

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"Ideas without owners die. Who's going to drive what?"
```

**Assign Owners:**
- Each activation idea gets an owner
- Owner's job: create detailed plan, get resources, execute
- Set check-in dates (weekly for first month)

---

### **Minute 15-20: Success Metrics**

**Facilitator Script:**
```
"How will we know if this works?

For each activation, define:
• Leading indicator (activity metric)
• Lagging indicator (outcome metric)"
```

**Example:**

- Lagging: 5 qualified leads from webinar

This was your work. Now let's make it real."
```

---

### **Minute 2-4: Reflection**

when we started? Let's go around the room."

(Capture the energy and sentiment)

```
"Next steps:
• I'll send summary doc within 24 hours

Thank you for your energy and ideas. Let's build a 
brand that gets Akiba noticed! 🚀"
```

## 🎯 FACILITATOR TIPS

### **Energy Management:**
- ✅ Take 5-min break every 45 minutes
- ✅ Use upbeat music during breaks
- ✅ Stand up exercises if energy drops
- ✅ Vary activity types (individual, pairs, groups)

### **Managing Difficult Dynamics:**

**If someone dominates:**
"Great points, [Name]. Let's hear from others. [Specific person], what do you think?"

**If group is quiet:**
"I'm going to give everyone 2 minutes to write ideas silently, then we'll share."

**If discussion goes off-track:**
"Important point, but let's capture that for later. Back to [topic]..."

**If conflict arises:**
"I'm hearing two perspectives. Both valid. Let's see if we can integrate them."
